# Email Response Automation with CrewAI LangGraph

Welcome to the Email Response Automation with CrewAI LangGraph repository! This project is inspired by the video ["LangGraph: Email Response Automation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eYg1OcHm5k) and aims to automate email responses using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and AI models. Below you will find detailed descriptions of the project's components, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Overview

### Introduction
This project leverages the power of CrewAI LangGraph, a sophisticated NLP tool, to automate the process of responding to emails. By integrating state-of-the-art language models and a well-defined workflow, the system can generate relevant and contextually accurate email responses, improving efficiency and productivity in handling email communications.

### Key Features
- **Automated Email Response Generation:** Automatically generate responses to incoming emails based on the content and context of the received message.
- **Context Awareness:** Maintain context across email threads to ensure coherent and relevant responses.
- **Integration with Email Services:** Seamlessly integrate with popular email services to fetch incoming emails and send automated responses.

## Components

### LangGraph Engine
The core of the system is the LangGraph engine, which processes incoming emails and generates appropriate responses.

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Uses advanced NLP techniques to understand the intent and context of incoming emails.
- **Language Model Integration:** Incorporates powerful language models like GPT-3 to generate human-like responses.
- **Context Management:** Maintains context across multiple email exchanges to ensure continuity and relevance in responses.

### Email Service Integration
Integrates with popular email services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) to fetch incoming emails and send automated responses.

- **Email Fetching:** Periodically fetches incoming emails from the connected email service.
- **Response Sending:** Sends generated responses back to the email service for delivery to the recipient.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to OpenAI GPT-3 API or similar language model API
- Email service credentials (e.g., Gmail API credentials)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-response-automation-with-crewai-langgraph.git
   cd email-response-automation-with-crewai-langgraph
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the necessary API keys and credentials:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_email_service_api_key
   EMAIL_SERVICE_API_SECRET=your_email_service_api_secret
   ```

4. **Configure Email Service:**
   Follow the instructions in the `email_service_config.md` file to set up and configure the email service integration.

## Usage

### Running the Application
